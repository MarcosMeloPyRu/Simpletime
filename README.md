# Simpletime
# This is my first project, made with the instructions of Larissa's Kich tutorial - https://youtu.be/GK0ok3ZCXwM
# With this project I was able to understand a few of the bases of HTML, CSS and JS.
# For exemple: Basic structures, how to link the languages, the utilization of "class" instead of "id", using "padStart" instead of "if" and last but not least how to import fonts and a favicon.
